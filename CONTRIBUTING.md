- After you submit an issue, the project maintainers will review it.  
- If your issue is accepted, it will be marked as such, and you can then proceed to the next steps.  
- Some issues may require further discussion or clarification.  

## Step 3: Fork and Create Your Branch

- Be sure to follow the existing code style and add or update tests as necessary to cover your changes.  

## Step 5: Submit a Pull Request  

- After implementing your changes, submit a pull request (PR) to the main repository.  
- In your pull request description, link to the issue you created and provide a summary of the changes as well as any other information that might be helpful for the reviewers.  

## Step 6: Review Process
