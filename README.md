## üåê Overview  

Welcome to the Illegal Dump Site Detection and Landfill Monitoring repository.  

This platform leverages advanced drone and satellite imagery to enhance waste management and environmental monitoring through cutting-edge technology.  

Utilizing high-resolution images combined with sophisticated image annotation, object detection models, and geospatial analysis, our system offers robust tools to identify illegal dump sites and effectively manage regulated landfills.  

### üóùÔ∏èKey Features  

- #### Dataset Management

  - Manage extensive datasets of drone and satellite images with tools for uploading, categorizing, and maintaining image data.  
  - Features include tagging, filtering, and robust data integrity checks to ensure dataset accuracy and usability for environmental monitoring tasks.

- #### Image Annotation  

  - Annotate high-resolution drone and satellite imagery to help train object detection models specifically designed for precise waste detection.  

- #### Object Detection Model Training  

  - Train sophisticated models with diverse image datasets from drone and satellite sources to enhance detection accuracy across varied environmental conditions.  

- #### Detection and Monitoring  

  - Deploy models, both pre-trained and newly trained, to detect waste sites from aerial perspectives.  
  - Results are displayed on a georeferenced map, providing a clear and actionable visual representation.  

- #### Landfill Management  

  - Advanced tools for managing legal landfills include the submission of waste forms and the integration of 3D point cloud scans derived from drone technology for detailed, real-time monitoring.  

This repository aims to equip researchers, environmental agencies, and policymakers with the tools needed to monitor and respond to environmental challenges efficiently.  

Join us in leveraging these capabilities to maintain ecological integrity and promote sustainable practices in waste management.

Please refer to our [Detailed Set-up Instructions](https://intelligentnetworksolutions.github.io/IllegalDumpSiteDetectionAndLandfillMonitoring/development/set-up.html) for installation instructions.

## üë®‚ÄçüíªDevelopment  

### üîíSecrets

We use the [dotnet user-secrets tool](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/app-secrets?view=aspnetcore-8.0&tabs=windows#secret-manager) to manage our secrets instead of appsettings.json files.  

For a detailed guide on how to implement and manage secrets in your development environment effectively:

- visit our [Secrets Management Guide](https://intelligentnetworksolutions.github.io/IllegalDumpSiteDetectionAndLandfillMonitoring/development/shhh_secrets.html)

### üìà Development Diagrams  

Our project utilizes a series of development diagrams to illustrate the architecture and workflow of the Illegal Dump Site Detection and Landfill Monitoring system.  
These diagrams are essential for developers and contributors to understand the overall structure and interaction of the components within the project.

You can view these diagrams in detail by visiting our [Development Diagrams page](https://intelligentnetworksolutions.github.io/IllegalDumpSiteDetectionAndLandfillMonitoring/diagrams/intro.html).  
Here, you will find visual representations that include system architecture diagrams, data flow diagrams, and other relevant graphical documentation that supports the development and maintenance of the project.

These resources are designed to provide clarity and facilitate a better understanding of the project‚Äôs technical framework, helping both new and existing contributors to navigate the project more effectively.  

### üî¨ Testing  

Our project uses XUnit for unit testing to ensure that each component functions correctly and meets the expected behavior.  
Coverlet is integrated for measuring the code coverage, which helps us maintain and improve the quality of our codebase.  

Please refer to our [Testing Information Document](https://intelligentnetworksolutions.github.io/IllegalDumpSiteDetectionAndLandfillMonitoring/development/testing.html) for installation instructions.
