# Audit Logs  

Audit Logs are a way of keeping track of what happens in the web application like logging in, making changes, or accessing sensitive information. These logs are extremely useful for understanding how the system is being used, spotting any unusual activity, and ensuring everything is running smoothly.

Audit logs track actions and changes made by users in the app like:  

- Login attempts: Who logged in, when, and from where.  
- Changes to data: When someone edits, deletes, or adds new information.  
- User management: If users are added, removed, or their roles are changed.  
- System settings: Changes made to the settings or configuration of the app.  
- Error messages: Any issues or errors that happen within the system.  

### Why Are Audit Logs Important ?  

Audit logs are important because they help:  

- Track changes: You can see what has been modified, who made the change, and when it happened. This is helpful for understanding how the system is evolving or diagnosing problems.  
- Ensure security: If something goes wrong, like an unauthorized person accessing the app or making a change, audit logs can help identify what happened and who was responsible.  
- Monitor compliance: In some cases, organizations need to follow certain rules or regulations, and audit logs help ensure that the system is being used correctly and safely.  
- Detect issues: If something isn’t working as expected, audit logs can provide clues to help administrators identify the cause.  

### How Can You View Audit Logs?  

If you're allowed to view the audit logs (usually for admins or users with special permissions), you can check them anytime to see the history of activities. The log will typically show:  

- Date and time of the action  
- Who performed the action (which user)  
- What was changed or accessed  
- The result of the action (for example, if a file was successfully updated or deleted)  

This gives a clear picture of what has been happening in the app, making it easier to keep track of everything.  

### Summary  

In short, Audit Logs are like a security camera for the web app. They record who did what and when, helping everyone keep track of changes, monitor for security issues, and ensure things are working properly. While regular users may not always need to view audit logs, they’re an important tool for admins to maintain the app’s security and proper functioning.
