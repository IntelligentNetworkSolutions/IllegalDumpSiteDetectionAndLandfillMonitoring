     - Name - Report title
     - Description - A brief overview of the report content
     - Created On - The date the report was generated  
     - View or analyze any historical data reports to track changes over time.

8. <strong>Ignore Zones</strong> tool 
   Manage areas that should be excluded from certain activities or analyses.
   - **Add Ignore Zone Button**: Create a new ignore zone by defining its boundaries on the map.
   - Ignore Zones List - View a list of all added ignore zones with the following options:
     - Focus on This Zone - Center the map on the selected ignore zone for further inspection.
     - Edit - Modify details or boundaries of an existing ignore zone.
     - Delete - Remove the ignore zone from the list.

9. <strong>Detection Input Images Tool</strong>
   Upload and manage images used for detection purposes:
   - Image List - View uploaded images with key details:
     - Name - The file name or identifier
     - Date Taken - The date the image was captured
     - Created By - The person who uploaded the image  
     - Checkbox - Select images to be displayed directly on the map for visual reference.

<h2><strong>Left-Side Menu Tools Overview:</strong></h2>

On the left side of the page, you have access to a comprehensive set of tools and options designed to manage and oversee all aspects of landfill operations. These tools allow for both day-to-day management and long-term strategic decision-making. Here's a breakdown of the available options:

1. <strong>[Dataset](../dataset-management/dataset-management-guide.md)</strong>
   This section allows you to manage and organize all the datasets used for landfill operations.  
   - Upload, view, and organize datasets.

2. <strong>[Training](/guides/training-process/training-guide.md)</strong>

   - Manage training data: Review and update training datasets used for detection.
   - Start or monitor training jobs for model development.
   - View and track model performance metrics and analytics to improve accuracy.

3. <strong>[Detection](/guides/detection-process/detection-guide.md)</strong>
   This tool enables you to set up, review, and analyze detection systems that are integrated into your landfill operations, including identifying waste types, monitoring landfill conditions, or detecting environmental changes.  
   - View the status of ongoing detection processes.
   - Analyze detection results, including alerts or anomalies detected in real-time.
   - Fine-tune detection algorithms for higher precision and reliability.

4. <strong>[Scheduled Runs](/guides/scheduled-runs/scheduled-runs-guide.md)</strong>
   Use this option to manage scheduled tasks or automated processes within the system, such as data processing, reporting, or model training.  
   - View a list of upcoming or past scheduled runs, including execution time and status.

5. <strong>[Landfills Management](/guides/landfill-management/landfill-management-guide.md)</strong>
   A central hub for overseeing all landfill operations, this section includes tools for monitoring landfill locations, tracking waste, managing trucks and equipment.  
   - <strong>Track Trucks:</strong> Manage the trucks used in landfill operations (as described in the Map Landing Page).
   - <strong>Waste Track:</strong> Monitor waste intake, disposal, and other operational metrics.

6. <strong>Admin</strong>
   The Admin section provides you with the necessary tools to manage user permissions, system settings, and other administrative tasks.

7. <strong>Super Admin</strong>  
   This section is for users with full administrative control over the system, enabling them to configure global settings, manage advanced features, and oversee all aspects of the application.
