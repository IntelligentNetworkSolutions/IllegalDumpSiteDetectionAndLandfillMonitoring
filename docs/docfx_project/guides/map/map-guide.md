# Map Guide  

This interactive tool provides a comprehensive and user-friendly interface for managing and visualizing landfill operations.  
The right and left side menus offers access to various tools that allow you to customize your map, measure distances and areas, view historic data, and manage specific zones.  

## Right-Side Menu Tools Overview  

### Map Layers  

Select and deselect different map layers to display various information relevant to your landfill operations.  

- Detection Ignore zones  
- Drone Imagery  
- Base Maps  
- Opacity adjuster : Adjust the transparency of layers for better visibility of underlying features.  
- Up/Down Button : Change the layer order to prioritize which information is displayed on top.  

### Last Extent  

- Quickly navigate to the last map extent you were viewing, making it easy to pick up where you left off.  

### Zoom to Area  

- Use this tool to zoom into a specific area of the map for detailed inspection.  
  - Simply select your area of interest, and the map will automatically zoom in for closer analysis.  

### Measure Length  

- Accurately measure the length of any feature or distance on the map.  
  - Click to set start and end points, and the system will calculate the distance.  

### Measure Area  

- Calculate the area of any enclosed region on the map.  
  - This tool allows you to draw polygons and will display the area within the selected boundaries.

### Go to Coordinates  

- Enter specific latitude and longitude coordinates to quickly navigate to any location on the map.  

### Historic Data  

Access past reports related to landfill operations:

- Report List - View a list of historic reports with key details  
  - Name - Report title  
  - Description - A brief overview of the report content  
  - Created On - The date the report was generated  
  - View or analyze any historical data reports to track changes over time.  

### Ignore Zones  

Manage areas that should be excluded from certain activities or analyses.  

- Add Ignore Zone Button: Create a new ignore zone by defining its boundaries on the map.  
- Ignore Zones List - View a list of all added ignore zones with the following options  
  - Focus on This Zone - Center the map on the selected ignore zone for further inspection.  
  - Edit - Modify details or boundaries of an existing ignore zone.  
  - Delete - Remove the ignore zone from the list.  

### Detection Input Images  

Upload and manage images used for detection purposes  

- Image List - View uploaded images with key details  
  - Name - The file name or identifier  
  - Date Taken - The date the image was captured  
  - Created By - The person who uploaded the image  
  - Checkbox - Select images to be displayed directly on the map for visual reference.

## Left-Side Menu Tools Overview  

On the left side of the page, you have access to a comprehensive set of tools and options designed to manage and oversee all aspects of landfill operations.  
These tools allow for both day-to-day management and long-term strategic decision-making.  

Here's a breakdown of the available options

### [Dataset](../dataset-management/dataset-management-guide.md)  

This section allows you to manage and organize all the datasets used for landfill operations.  

- Upload, view, and organize datasets.  

### [Training](../training-process/training-guide.md)  

This option is designed for the machine learning models and AI algorithms used in landfill management, providing tools for training and refining these systems.  

- Manage training data: Review and update training datasets used for detection.
- Start or monitor training jobs for model development.  
- View and track model performance metrics and analytics to improve accuracy.  

### [Detection](../detection-process/detection-guide.md)  

This tool enables you to set up, review, and analyze detection systems that are integrated into your landfill operations, including identifying waste types, monitoring landfill conditions, or detecting environmental changes.  

- View the status of ongoing detection processes.  
- Analyze detection results, including alerts or anomalies detected in real-time.  
- Fine-tune detection algorithms for higher precision and reliability.  

### [Scheduled Runs](../scheduled-runs/scheduled-runs-guide.md)  

Use this option to manage scheduled tasks or automated processes within the system, such as data processing, reporting, or model training.  

- View a list of upcoming or past scheduled runs, including execution time and status.  

### [Landfills Management](../landfill-management/landfill-management-guide.md)  

A central hub for overseeing all landfill operations, this section includes tools for monitoring landfill locations, tracking waste, managing trucks and equipment.  

- Track Trucks: Manage the trucks used in landfill operations (as described in the Map Landing Page).  
- Waste Track: Monitor waste intake, disposal, and other operational metrics.  

### [3D Point Cloud](../landfill-management/3d-point-cloud-guide.md)  

- Upload/Convert Point Cloud  
- View Point Clouds  
- Compare Point Clouds  

### Admin  

The Admin section provides you with the necessary tools to manage user permissions, system settings, and other administrative tasks.  

### Super Admin  

This section is for users with full administrative control over the system, enabling them to configure global settings, manage advanced features, and oversee all aspects of the application.
